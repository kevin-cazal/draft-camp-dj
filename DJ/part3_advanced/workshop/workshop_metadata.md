# Workshop: DJ Mixing Deck - Customization - Metadata

## Target Audience

**Primary Audience**: High school students (ages 14-18) who have completed the DJ Mixing Deck Starter workshop.

**Prerequisites**:
- Completion of Workshop: DJ Mixing Deck Starter (or equivalent experience)
- Understanding of p5.js objects and properties
- Familiarity with sound playback and volume control in p5.js
- Basic understanding of file handling concepts
- Ability to follow step-by-step instructions

**Learning Level**: Intermediate

**Accessibility**: This workshop builds on the DJ Mixing Deck Starter. Students should have a working DJ deck before adding customization features. The goal is to introduce file upload functionality and user customization.

## Writing Style & Pedagogical Approach

### Why Code is Not Directly Given

**1. Active Learning Over Passive Consumption**
- Students learn better by constructing code themselves rather than copying it
- When students write code themselves, they develop deeper understanding
- Copying code creates a false sense of understanding - students think they know it because they can see it works, but they may not understand why

**2. Problem-Solving Skills Development**
- By providing logic, concepts, and examples instead of code, students must think through the problem
- This develops critical thinking and problem-solving abilities
- Students learn to translate concepts into code, which is a core programming skill

**3. Reduced Cognitive Load**
- Too much code at once can overwhelm beginners
- Focusing on one concept at a time allows students to understand before moving forward
- Students can process the "why" before the "how"

**4. Encourages Exploration and Experimentation**
- Without complete code solutions, students are more likely to try variations
- Mistakes become learning opportunities rather than failures
- Students develop confidence by figuring things out themselves

**5. Real-World Application**
- Professional developers rarely have complete code solutions - they have requirements, logic, and documentation
- This approach mirrors real-world development where you must translate requirements into code
- Students learn to read documentation and apply concepts, not just copy code

### Pedagogical Value

**Conceptual Understanding First**
- Students learn the "why" before the "how"
- Understanding the logic behind code makes it easier to remember and apply
- Concepts transfer to other programming languages and projects

**Scaffolded Learning**
- Concepts are introduced progressively
- Each step builds on previous understanding
- Analogies and real-world examples help students connect new concepts to known experiences

**Multiple Learning Styles**
- Visual learners: Schema placeholders and diagrams
- Auditory learners: Verbal explanations and analogies
- Kinesthetic learners: Hands-on coding practice
- Reading learners: Written explanations and documentation links

**Ownership and Pride**
- Students create something that is truly theirs
- The final product represents their understanding and effort
- This builds confidence and motivation to continue learning

**Error-Driven Learning**
- Students will make mistakes, and that's valuable
- Working through errors teaches debugging skills
- Understanding why something doesn't work is as important as understanding why it does

**Documentation Skills**
- Students learn to read and use official documentation
- This is a critical real-world skill
- Links to documentation teach students to find answers independently

## Duration Estimation

**Total Workshop Duration**: 1.5 - 2 hours

### Breakdown by Section:

**Introduction & Setup** (10-15 minutes)
- Welcome and introduction
- Understanding customization goals
- Review of DJ Mixing Deck Starter concepts
- Starting with working DJ deck
- Testing existing functionality

**Step 1: Understanding File Uploads** (20-25 minutes)
- Understanding file input elements
- How file uploads work in web browsers
- File types and restrictions
- User interaction with file inputs

**Step 2: Adding Background Image Upload** (25-30 minutes)
- Creating file input for images
- Handling image file selection
- Loading images from files
- Displaying uploaded images as background

**Step 3: Adding Sound Upload for Track 1** (25-30 minutes)
- Creating file input for audio
- Handling audio file selection
- Loading sounds from files
- Replacing existing sounds with uploaded ones

**Step 4: Adding Sound Upload for Track 2** (20-25 minutes)
- Repeating sound upload for second track
- Understanding code reuse
- Testing both track uploads

**Step 5: Improving User Experience** (15-20 minutes)
- Adding labels for file inputs
- Handling edge cases (no file selected, wrong file type)
- Testing all upload features

**Putting It All Together** (10-15 minutes)
- Final integration
- Testing all features
- Troubleshooting
- Customization suggestions
- Q&A and wrap-up

### Factors Affecting Duration:

**Faster Groups** (1.5 hours):
- Students with good grasp of Starter concepts
- Quick learners who understand file handling
- Good problem-solving skills
- Minimal technical issues

**Average Groups** (1.5-2 hours):
- Students comfortable with Starter basics
- Normal learning pace
- Some experimentation and questions
- Occasional troubleshooting

**Slower Groups** (2-2.5 hours):
- Students needing review of Starter concepts
- More time for file handling concept explanation
- Frequent questions and clarification
- More time for experimentation
- Technical difficulties
- Additional support needed

### Tips for Timing:

- **Plan for flexibility**: Allow extra time for questions and exploration
- **Break points**: Consider a break after Step 3
- **Differentiation**: Faster students can add more customization while others catch up
- **Support**: Have helpers available for students who need extra assistance
- **Optional extensions**: Have additional challenges ready for early finishers

### Recommended Workshop Structure:

1. **Introduction** (10 min)
2. **Step 1** (25 min)
3. **Step 2** (30 min)
4. **Short Break** (10 min)
5. **Step 3** (30 min)
6. **Step 4** (25 min)
7. **Step 5** (20 min)
8. **Integration & Wrap-up** (15 min)
9. **Q&A and Customization** (10 min)

**Total**: ~2 hours with breaks and flexibility

## Success Criteria

By the end of this workshop, students should be able to:
- ✅ Understand how file uploads work in web applications
- ✅ Create file input elements in p5.js
- ✅ Handle image file uploads and display them
- ✅ Handle audio file uploads and use them in the DJ deck
- ✅ Replace existing assets with user-uploaded files
- ✅ Understand file type restrictions and validation
- ✅ Create a customizable DJ deck that users can personalize
- ✅ Handle edge cases in file uploads
- ✅ Read and use documentation for file handling
- ✅ Troubleshoot basic file upload errors
- ✅ Have a functional, customizable DJ mixing deck

**Note**: Not all students will complete everything perfectly, and that's okay. The goal is understanding file handling and user customization, not perfection.
