# Workshop: DJ Mixing Deck - Metadata

## Target Audience

**Primary Audience**: High school students (ages 14-18) who are new to programming or have minimal programming experience.

**Prerequisites**:
- Basic familiarity with using a computer and web browser
- Ability to follow step-by-step instructions
- No prior programming experience required - we'll explain everything as we go!

**Learning Level**: Beginner

**Accessibility**: This workshop is designed for absolute beginners. We'll explain all programming concepts (variables, functions, objects) from scratch. The goal is to introduce programming through a fun, interactive project while learning object-oriented thinking and interactive programming patterns.

## Writing Style & Pedagogical Approach

### Why Code is Not Directly Given

**1. Active Learning Over Passive Consumption**
- Students learn better by constructing code themselves rather than copying it
- When students write code themselves, they develop deeper understanding
- Copying code creates a false sense of understanding - students think they know it because they can see it works, but they may not understand why

**2. Problem-Solving Skills Development**
- By providing logic, concepts, and examples instead of code, students must think through the problem
- This develops critical thinking and problem-solving abilities
- Students learn to translate concepts into code, which is a core programming skill

**3. Reduced Cognitive Load**
- Too much code at once can overwhelm beginners
- Focusing on one concept at a time allows students to understand before moving forward
- Students can process the "why" before the "how"

**4. Encourages Exploration and Experimentation**
- Without complete code solutions, students are more likely to try variations
- Mistakes become learning opportunities rather than failures
- Students develop confidence by figuring things out themselves

**5. Real-World Application**
- Professional developers rarely have complete code solutions - they have requirements, logic, and documentation
- This approach mirrors real-world development where you must translate requirements into code
- Students learn to read documentation and apply concepts, not just copy code

### Pedagogical Value

**Conceptual Understanding First**
- Students learn the "why" before the "how"
- Understanding the logic behind code makes it easier to remember and apply
- Concepts transfer to other programming languages and projects

**Scaffolded Learning**
- Concepts are introduced progressively
- Each step builds on previous understanding
- Analogies and real-world examples help students connect new concepts to known experiences

**Multiple Learning Styles**
- Visual learners: Schema placeholders and diagrams
- Auditory learners: Verbal explanations and analogies
- Kinesthetic learners: Hands-on coding practice
- Reading learners: Written explanations and documentation links

**Ownership and Pride**
- Students create something that is truly theirs
- The final product represents their understanding and effort
- This builds confidence and motivation to continue learning

**Error-Driven Learning**
- Students will make mistakes, and that's valuable
- Working through errors teaches debugging skills
- Understanding why something doesn't work is as important as understanding why it does

**Documentation Skills**
- Students learn to read and use official documentation
- This is a critical real-world skill
- Links to documentation teach students to find answers independently

- Applying volume to playing sounds
- Testing volume control

**Putting It All Together** (15-20 minutes)
- Final integration
- Testing all features
- Troubleshooting
- Customization suggestions
- Q&A and wrap-up

### Factors Affecting Duration:

**Faster Groups** (2-2.5 hours):
- Quick learners who grasp programming concepts easily
- Students who understand object-oriented thinking quickly
- Good problem-solving skills
- Minimal technical issues

**Average Groups** (2.5-3 hours):
- Normal learning pace
- Students comfortable with basic programming concepts
- Some experimentation and questions
- Occasional troubleshooting

**Slower Groups** (3-3.5 hours):
- Students needing more time to understand programming basics
- More time for object-oriented concept explanation
- Frequent questions and clarification
- More time for experimentation
- Technical difficulties
- Additional support needed

### Tips for Timing:

- **Plan for flexibility**: Allow extra time for questions and exploration
- **Break points**: Consider breaks after Step 3 and Step 5
- **Differentiation**: Faster students can customize while others catch up
- **Support**: Have helpers available for students who need extra assistance
- **Optional extensions**: Have additional challenges ready for early finishers

### Recommended Workshop Structure:

1. **Introduction** (10 min)
2. **Step 1** (35 min)
3. **Step 2** (25 min)
4. **Short Break** (10 min)
5. **Step 3** (30 min)
6. **Step 4** (35 min)
7. **Step 5** (40 min)
8. **Step 6** (30 min)
9. **Integration & Wrap-up** (20 min)
10. **Q&A and Customization** (15 min)

**Total**: ~3 hours with breaks and flexibility

## Success Criteria

By the end of this workshop, students should be able to:
- ✅ Create and use objects to organize related data
- ✅ Understand object properties and how to access them
- ✅ Load sounds using preload()
- ✅ Create and position interactive buttons
- ✅ Create and use volume sliders
- ✅ Implement toggle functionality (play/pause)
- ✅ Control sound volume in real-time
- ✅ Mix multiple sounds simultaneously
- ✅ Understand the relationship between objects and their properties
- ✅ Read and use documentation
- ✅ Troubleshoot basic errors
- ✅ Have a functional, interactive DJ mixing deck

**Note**: Not all students will complete everything perfectly, and that's okay. The goal is understanding object-oriented thinking and more complex interactions, not perfection.
